Customizing DocBook
===================

Now that you have seen some sample output for a document you might want to change the output.  This is done by setting parameters in the DocBook stylesheets.  Some examples of customizations:
 
* changing the CSS stylesheet
* change default image widths
* use profiles when creating your document
* add bookmarks to the PDF
* changing the fonts used in the PDF
