Readme book1
============

The files in the folder are used to build a book. There are AsciiDoc files which are the content of the book, some special content such as a CSV file, a python chart, and a book info file in XML (for DocBook). 

There are 2 book files. Use the book_simple.asciidoc file to build a book using simple content without any special AsiiDoc plugins. 

Use the book_advanced.asciidoc file to build a book with some advanced features of AsciiDoc such as creating a table from a CSV file, creating a chart from a Pychart file, creating a QR code image and running scripts whose results are included in the book. These special features require additional configuration of AsciiDoc.  See the AsciiDoc website for more information on these features.

Images displayed in the book can be stored in the images folder.
