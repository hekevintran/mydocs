Collection of docbook solutions

There are two solutions here.  The first, uses AsciiDoc markup to create multiple text files that can be built into a book or website.  The second is a collection of DocBook customizations that I have found useful.

My wiki pages here give information on creating a toolchain to build documents using DocBook but you can also use the software that comes with AsciiDoc or export your text from AsciiDoc to DocBook and then use your preferred DocBook tools to make the final document output.  

Why use AsciiDoc?

There are many other markup languages that allow users to edit and format files 


AsciiDoc can be downloaded from http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/.
